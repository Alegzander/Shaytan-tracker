	 * For instance, if English stemming is enabled in the index, "shoes" will be highlighted even if keyword is "shoe".

	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>"before_match": A string to insert before a keyword match. Default is "&ltb&gt".</li>
	 *   <li>"after_match": A string to insert after a keyword match. Default is "&l/tb&gt".</li>
	 *   <li>"chunk_separator": A string to insert between snippet chunks (passages). Default is " ... ".</li>
	 *   <li>"limit": Maximum snippet size, in symbols (codepoints). Integer, default is 256.</li>
	 *   <li>"around": How much words to pick around each matching keywords block. Integer, default is 5.</li>
	 *   <li>"exact_phrase": Whether to highlight exact query phrase matches only instead of individual keywords. Boolean, default is false.</li>
	 *   <li>"single_passage": Whether to extract single best passage only. Boolean, default is false.</li>
	 *   <li>"weight_order": Whether to sort the extracted passages in order of relevance (decreasing weight), or in order of appearance in the document (increasing position). Boolean, default is false.</li>
